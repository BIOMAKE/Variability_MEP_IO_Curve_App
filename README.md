# MEP_IO_Curve_App
The high response variability has become a key topic in brain stimulation. One example that demonstrates high variability are motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). MEPs are among the few readily observable direct responses to suprathreshold stimuli, e.g., of transcranial magnetic stimulation, and serve for a variety of applications, often in the form of dose--response curves, also called recruitment or input--output (IO) curves. However, MEPs and thus IO curves show extreme trial-to-trial variability that can exceed more than two decimal orders of magnitude. Recent studies have identified issues in previous statistical analysis of IO curves and introduced better methods, others could quantitatively separate several widely independent variability sources. However, research has failed providing the field with a user-friendly implementation of the methods for analysing such IO curves statistically sound and separating variability so that they were limited to a few groups. We implemented recent IO curve methods with a graphical user interface in the MATLAB App Designer and provide the code as well as compiled versions for Mac, Linux, and Windows.
